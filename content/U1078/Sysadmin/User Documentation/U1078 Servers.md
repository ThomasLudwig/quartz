### FileSystem

Each user has 4 personnal directories
- `/home/username` this directory is private to each server
- `/WORKING_DIRECTORY/username` (linked to `/home/username/working_directory` ) this directory is shared accross all servers
- `/PROGS/conda/username` which stores conda libraries and environments
- `/PROGS/scripts/username` in which the scripts you are developping should be stored
    - This also to separate scripts from PROJECTS data, thus granted acces to your scripts to other users, thatare not allows to access the same projects as you
    - The subdirectory `/PROGS/scripts/username/bin` is available in your path. By symlinking a scripts to this directory, it makes it available from any directory. Ex `ln -s /PROGS/scripts/username/ProjectsA/Sorting/mybestsortingalgorithm.sh /PROGS/scripts/username/bin`

There are also some directories shared accross the servers
- `/PROGS` that contains available programs
    - `/PROGS/EXTERN` that contains public softwares
